# battleship
Python implementation of the game Battleship.

Run the file `main.py`

## Steps
You have to start off with assigning your ships to the board.
You have five ships:
- BattleShip: BBBB
- Cruiser: CCC
- Aircraft Carrier: AAAAA
- Submarine: SSS
- Destroyer: DD

They all start off in their horizontal positions, however to rotate them you can put in 
the numbers 0-3 to rotate them in 90 degree clock-wise intervals.

## How to play
You have the first move where you attack the Computer's board. 
If you hit a ship, there will be a message that pops up saying whether 
you hit or miss the target. The process is similar when the Computer gets to attack your Board.

The first side to lose all their ships loses!
